# 📊 Social Network Data Analysis using Python

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **social network data stored in JSON format** can be
loaded, cleaned, structured, and analyzed using **Python**.

It simulates basic features of real social media platforms, including:

* 👥 **People You May Know** — friend recommendations based on mutual connections
* 👍 **Pages You Might Like** — page suggestions based on shared interests

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how **data relationships and shared interests** are used in
real-world social networking platforms to generate **meaningful recommendations**.

---

## 🧹 Data Processing Steps

* Load JSON data into Python
* Clean missing or invalid user information
* Remove duplicate friends and pages
* Filter inactive users
* Structure the dataset for analysis

---

## 🤖 Recommendation Features

### 1️⃣ People You May Know

Suggests new friends based on:

* Mutual friends
* Existing network connections

### 2️⃣ Pages You Might Like

Recommends pages using:

* Shared interests between users
* Relevance based on common liked pages

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in **Jupyter Notebook**
3. Make sure the **JSON dataset file** is in the same folder
4. Run all cells to see data cleaning and recommendations
